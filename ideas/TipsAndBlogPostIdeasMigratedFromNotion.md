# Tips & Blog Post Ideas

- Post idea - a roundup of ideas for collaborative work ("pairing" though maybe that word is too specific) for different use cases. Can be mixed and matched. For example, some people can't pay attention long, so they might need to do a short and/or async things like PR and Slack.
    - Slack written messages- here using threads can help a lot
    - VoiceThread - leaving messages on a problem or presentation, in a thread, and giving edit access so collaborators can add slides of their own.
    - VSCode liveshare
    - Zoom/Hangouts/Slack calls with screenshare - the classical pairing where someone drives and someone navigates
- Post idea: Add keyboard and a11y support for dynamically adding and removing input fields (resource: [article by Mustapha Abdul-Rasaq](https://geekmaros.hashnode.dev/dynamically-addremove-input-fields-using-vuejs-ckhottr8o052ieks14uk41fhp))
- Post idea: How to extend a component
- Post idea: What is VM in Vue?
- Pen/Post idea: Make a fast/cheap/good toggle like [this giphy](https://media1.giphy.com/media/I7183SWqDxhkY/giphy.gif?cid=6104955e9d1e66c603361625a948ec532b4cc8659e534de0&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)
- Post idea: "All the ways to wait" - Describe differences between flushPromises(), NextTick, and whatever else there is.
- Tutorial idea - how to make a copy button
- Post idea: I struggled with box-shadows, particularly why z-index is necessary for a box with a box-shadow to show up on top (even if abs positioning isn't needed). The box shadow wouldn't show up without z-index, maybe because "[Shadows do not influence layout and may overlap (or be overlapped by) other boxes and text or their shadows.](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#shadow-layers)"
- If a module for your node_modules won't install, it may be as quick of a fix as making sure that a newer (or older, or just specific) version of the module is specified in package.json.
- *Also look in the Sparkbox Learning Diary*
- Blog post about how I'm making blog post ideas (as part of daily routine, not making myself write them)
- Tips for supporting ADHD people on your team - have a shared calendar, and do remind them if it a meeting is coming up or has been rescheduled. Rescheduling meetings is, I feel, harder for ADHD people.
- A tutorial where you just show a word of the day, and have the option to sign up for text of the word of the day through Twilio
- "What are $attrs" - "Contains parent-scope attribute bindings (except for class and style) that are not recognized (and extracted) as props." but I still don't get it!
- How to contribute to OSS documentation - Documentation is often offered as a first step to getting involved with Open Source, but how do we even get to that first step? Clone repo, figure out what the rules are for submitting issues, etc.
- Vue test utils - Snapshots in unit tests - is this e2e? integration?
- Vue test utils - Snapshots - in files or inline?
- Vue test utils + vuelidate - how to test?
- How to format a contact page for A11y (physical address, phone, fax, maps, etc.)

- [ ]  Look up PracticeFusion

Doximity

- Dialer (we use Doxy)
- Social Network
    - Read and comment on articles
- Look up other physicians who might be dealing with your patient
- Ask community of physicians (probably interest-based groups)
- Send secure information to other providers on the platform (idk if this is paid feature or not)

## TALK IDEA: Stunning Slides

## Caring for Your Audience

### Who are they?

Live conference attendees are more likely to get a special experience by being there. They've made an investment to come see you.

Co-workers may want more technical information, and may want calls to action

Regular meetup attendees may want more calls to action, and can follow up with you later about the technical information.

Online asynchronous participants may need more context in the slides.

### Technical Level

Decide early, but be flexible. This might mean skipping slides, or maybe even having a few extra slides you can show if the audience wishes.

### Accessibility

Number one goal - audience easily absorb information. Your slides should make this job easier.

Use your presenter notes if you want to add a lot of info.

If you have a lot of words or speaker notes on each slide, consider writing a blog post to accompany the slides.

If you can have a transcript, link to it into the slide deck! If not, then you may want to make the speaker notes available afterwards.

## Be Good To You

### Build Your Brand

Talks are also a way to position yourself as an authority on the subject. Be subtle, but do keep this in mind.

Put your Twitter handle, or at least your name, on every slide. Attendees often take pics of slides, and you always want to have your name on it.

Mention the Twitter (or other social media) handles of authorities on the subject. You'll then be enhancing your brand as an authority and a connector.

Put the hashtag for the event on all slides.

### Be Prepared

Create a copy of the talk as a PDF and email it to yourself. 

Put it on a thumb drive.

Put it online somewhere you can access without signing in (eg, Google Docs, with the sharing settings made public)

Have your own dongle, and preferably your own clicker. Know how they work. If you absolutely cannot get ahold of these, then tell the organizers as far in advance as possible.

Proofread your slides. Have other people proofread your slides.

Plan where you will host the slides later (the conference orgs I know don't usually want to host them). (eg. https://speakerdeck.com/, slideshare, github)

Tweet out where you will host the slides

Schedule the tweet with where your slides will be hosted

 Idea: Have someone read your slides back to you, and try to tell you what each slides main point is.

### Be consistent

Be consistent - express the same kinds of things in the same ways

If you're planning on using the deck multiple times, it's especially important that each of the slides be self explanatory within the context of the presentation. There's a thing about code not being yours if you haven't seen it in six months, and I think the same is true of slides.

Be consistent about the types of information

### Create a creative process

You may want to create an outline before you make the deck, but making the deck is how some people I know actually think through their talk. Figure out what works for you.

Go easy on yourself, at least at first. You can use something cool line Reveal, but Google slides, PowerPoint, and Keynote are all great too. Whatever gets you going and keeps things as standardized as possible.

Create a couple of slide styles you like and then just copy the slides as you go.

## Make It Sparkle

### Platforms

Prezi

Powerpoint

Keynote

Google Slides

Slides.com

Reveal.JS

[DeckSet](https://www.deckset.com/)

Canva

Notion Maybe

[Envatto](https://elements.envato.com/presentation-templates/compatible-with-google-slides) (a marketplace for templates)

### Audio/Video

If you must include audio, talk to the organizers ahead of time, and make sure you know the setup of the room. Also make a backup plan, bc there's a good chance things won't go smoothly.

No flashing video

What does WCAG say? This can help.

### Patterns

Slide patterns: Build your own library of patterns over time. 

Ex: 

Header slides, definition slides, example slides, basic slides, statistics slides, chart slides, list slides

### Charts, Graphs, and Data (oh my)

If you can, recreate the charts and graphs within the slide program itself. If not, make sure that your images are high-resolution!

Don't forget to cite your sources.

Charts often need call outs to make sense of the data. Use contrasting colors to communicate the message about the data.

### Coding

If including images of code, be sure to use line numbers. Also, highlight the way the code changed.

If you are doing screenshots, I highly recommend just zooming in on the part of the screen that is relevant. I've seen big projectors do bad things to full screen screenshots.

Consider putting up a codepen or GitHub gistsof the code.

If you were thinking of live coding, probably don't. Instead, let the slides do that by making videos or just including actual trxt. Also, don't autoplay the video. Carbon can help screenshot code. 

### Colors

Use accessible contrast levels. This is not just about the colors, but also about the thickness of the lines.

Use a simple color palette - use the darkest and lightest for background and text, and the other two colors for the highlights

### Images

Make your visuals consistent, and make them work for your brand.

Make your visuals simple, keep them cohesive (eg. all cats, or all )

Combine text and images (photos, icons, shapes)

Photos: use the image as a background to drive the point home. Take care to make sure the text can still be seen.

Icons - noun project is great

Shapes - relate pieces of text on the screen with shapes (eg. arrows for a multi-step process)

When using images, attribute them, caption them

Have a slide with resources-you'll be the authority then, bc you'll be the way that's gotten people to info

### Fonts

Use a couple of fonts (not many!), use a contrasting font for different elements, highlighting, etc.

Use custom fonts, as most built-in fonts are used for reading paragraphs

### Story

It's about the story - people don't remember the data as much as they remember the story

Learn from your favorite stories - the "three act" format is helpful.
1st act - lay the scene, 2nd - throw the twist, 3rd - resolve

Convey emotion - talks are performative, informative, and emotional - that's what sets that a live talk apart from a video.

Have themed slides, and be sure to include transition slides for when you change topics.

### Text

Clarity > wit

Limit the number of words, but get your point across. One idea per slide is a good rule.

If you have a slide with a lot of text, reveal the text bit by bit with animations. When ppl see a new slide, their attention goes from you to the slide, and you don't want them to be reading while they should be listening to you.

Use calls to action

Use very small sentences (you may not even need complete sentences)

### Special Info

Make your important info stand out from the rest - use color, shape, size

Contrast within slides (highlighted words), contrast between slides (eg., different background color for transition slides)

### Slides not to forget!

Questions - if you will take questions, have a quick slide that reads, 'Questions?'

Resources - give a curated list of links to more information. Do title them so that people know what they're clicking on

Contact - have a slide where people can know how to contact you.
