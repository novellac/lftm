From the student sidebar transition card:

FOR MONDAY: It's the focus method here that gives a weird flash of unstyled content!
I tried putting a transition on the button, v-showing the button instead of v-iffing...not really sure what the cause is!!!

Other than that I think I'm about done with this. One thing I could do is to try and reinstate the CSS grid pattern
we were using, buuuut I'm not really sure WHY we were using grid or why that was necessary.
I mean maybe I could transition column number? Who knows
Also I kiiiind of dislike this width transition - the text gets all squished up. It's too fast to see at 300ms, but
maybe we could do an offscreen thing and transition the x something or other? Who knows.
