## Monday 01.13

- It is my bugsnag week
- Fixing highcharts print option (printfixes.md)
- Made a Trello card for Bugsnag for a login issue. I should also add a bugsnag breadcrumb.

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Fix the highcharts print option

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- It was a really, really hard day.
- Work announced the removal of floating 7day holidays and transition to a standard US schedule. Ugh.

#### Stressors

- Work changed the time off policy in a way that will hurt me but I don't trust anyone there enough to talk about it.

## Tuesday 01.14

- Implemented Highcharts workaround (see printfixes.md)
- Upgraded Highcharts version from 11x to 12x (see printfixes.md)
- Fixed an issue with dark and light modes on Highcharts (see printfixes.md)

### Reminders

### Notes

- Failed at pulling back on the quirkiness and mentioned menopause in relation to me forgetting stuff and writing everything down. Thankfully was only on a call with a couple fe people but come on self. Don't be so damn neurodivergent. As if I can just shut it off lol.
- Last week first week of 2025 was catch up
- This week bugsnag
- Previous weeks holidays


#### Stressors

- CN DMed for rubric updates which fair but now also yay back to stressing about rubrics as though I wasn't stressing enough! Went with this:

```Thanks for checking in! tl;dr not ready for poking yet but I'll keep you updated and press things a bit faster. Little longer: Just before the holidays I ran into a really gnarly issue with deleting the rows and columns from the rubrics. I worked on it solo over the holiday slowdown and have been playing catch up last week and this week. I've got it mostly figured out, but pairing with Megan early next week to see if we can't get it entirely knocked out. I don't expect BE to be much of an issue since I've been coding things based on the mock result that Adam gave me.```
