## Monday 01.20

- Made issue and build (but the plan tooling seems broken) to address SCSS warnings about `@import` rules.
- Got a new component (not usable, just for show) with the criteria and indicators instead of judge and scores.
- Made the repo with the minimal repro and DM'ed MH with my proposed course of action.

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Make the rubric stuff reusable

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind.
