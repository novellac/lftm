## Monday 01.20

- Made issue and build (but the plan tooling seems broken) to address SCSS warnings about `@import` rules.
- Got a new component (not usable, just for show) with the criteria and indicators instead of judge and scores.
- Made the repo with the minimal repro and DM'ed MH with my proposed course of action.

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Make the rubric stuff reusable

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind.

## Tuesday 01.21

## Wednesday 01.22

- Worked on the stuff in the "minimalAgain" doc here this repo.
-- Got a SFC with lots of scoped slots ot use for the table
-- Put the table in through SB. It's a LOT like the RubricTable so I think I will have a quick time pulling that in!
- Added Tina.io to AStarter

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Made a new RubricTable to transfer my work over
- Make sure it works with the different modes (view/grade/edit)

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- You have to fight for what matters each day.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind.
- National politics. As it related to work in particular, I'm afraid that the company will care even less about a11y since now it's "illegal" to treat other humans equitably.

## Thursday 01.23

- Dug into some BS errors related to language preference for SL
- Got much of the way through removing the dedicated criteria thing. I'm kind of on to a related issue which is that not all cells in a row necessarily have the same properties! So when you add a new row, you need to pass in some mock data, right? If you can't depend on the cells all having the same format then you'd need to pass in an entire row, because there's no way TWRRAC can know how you want your row shaped.But what if you add a column? Now your row only knows about N kinds of cells, but there are actually N+1 cells in a row! Could we have a ref in TWRRAC that holds the updated row shape, and when addCol gets run we add that onto the row shape? That might not be a bad idea. We can then use a prop for the initial "placeholder" row, and just add to it/subtract from it as the user clicks add/remove row. Alternatively we could manage that in the parent or a setup file, but I don't love those.
The idea behind using a prop to set the initial new row placeholders and using the fn args to set the add new col cells is that, while the cells could each be shaped differently when you add a row, when you add a col you can expect the shape of the cell on each row to be the same. This new cell passed in through the new col fn arg will get added onto the placeholder row, and removed from the placeholder row when deleting the col.

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
