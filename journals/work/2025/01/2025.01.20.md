## Monday 01.20

- Made issue and build (but the plan tooling seems broken) to address SCSS warnings about `@import` rules.
- Got a new component (not usable, just for show) with the criteria and indicators instead of judge and scores.
- Made the repo with the minimal repro and DM'ed MH with my proposed course of action.

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Make the rubric stuff reusable

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind.

## Wednesday 01.22

- Worked on the stuff in the "minimalAgain" doc here this repo.
-- Got a SFC with lots of scoped slots ot use for the table
-- Put the table in through SB. It's a LOT like the RubricTable so I think I will have a quick time pulling that in!

### Soon

- Fix the damn scrollbars for everyone
- Work on DFT
- Made a new RubricTable to transfer my work over
- Make sure it works with the different modes (view/grade/edit)

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- You have to fight for what matters each day.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind.
- National politics. As it related to work in particular, I'm afraid that the company will care even less about a11y since now it's "illegal" to treat other humans equitably.
