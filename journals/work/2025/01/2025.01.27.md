- Work on DFT

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.

#### Stressors

## Tuesday 01.28

- DONE: Read synopsis from last week
- Rubric work - I got a lot done! I finished the placeholders for removing cols and rows, I renamed things away from criteria/indicators, and wrote the todos for the tests. And maybe more?

### Soon

- Work on DFT
- JT 12pm 
- Update AStarter and re-start the ywco repo based on AStarter.
- Finish the units for TWRRAC and push up the PR again.

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- Keep going.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind. Why the FFFF is everyone so much faster at this than me???
- National politics. As it related to work in particular, I'm afraid that the company will care even less about a11y since now it's "illegal" to treat other humans equitably.
