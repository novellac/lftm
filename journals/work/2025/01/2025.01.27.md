## Monday 01.27

- TODO: Read synopsis from last week

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.

## Tuesday 01.28

- DONE: Read synopsis from last week
- Rubric work - I got a lot done! I finished the placeholders for removing cols and rows, I renamed things away from criteria/indicators, and wrote the todos for the tests. And maybe more?

### Soon

- Work on DFT
- Update AStarter and re-start the ywco repo based on AStarter.
- Finish the units for TWRRAC and push up the PR again.

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- Keep going.

#### Stressors
