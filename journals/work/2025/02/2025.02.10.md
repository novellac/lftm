## Monday 02.10

- Keep working on the rubric version - see the rubrics/hub for some of the things I'm running up against wrt BE table data
- Start thinking about TWRRAC styling. Maybe make a variants file for styling? I think it's ok to think about this when doing the rubric bc that's when we'll bump up against it.
- DONE created a draft palette for Aster
- Both the TWRRAC and the RubricTable need to change the data. Is there any way I can hand functions from RubricTable to TWRRAC without TWRRAC needing to know what they are, and it will execute those fns?
- DONE: Moved all the fns into a setup file so that we can safely mutate the data. TWRRAC is only being used for layout basically.

### Soon

- Maybe remove TW from Aster?
- Figure out how to package up the Tina components
- Figure out how to package up the Vue components (would layers work for this?)

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- Keep going.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind. Why the FFFF is everyone so much faster at this than me???
- National politics. As it related to work in particular, I'm afraid that the company will care even less about a11y since now it's "illegal" to treat other humans equitably.
