## Monday 02.03

- Maybe work on AStarter?
- DONE Finish writing up the PR for TWRRAC.
- DONE Text SM and AB about the housing
- Responded some to the comments on TWRRAC.

### Soon

- Make sure TWRRAC has the ability to create its own rowId/colId
- Check in with M. on DFT progress
- Maybe remove TW from Aster?
- Make palette for Aster
- Figure out how to package up the Tina components
- Figure out how to package up the Vue components (would layers work for this?)

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- Keep going.

### Notes

- 

#### Stressors

- Feeling really behind. Why the FFFF is everyone so much faster at this than me???
- National politics. As it related to work in particular, I'm afraid that the company will care even less about a11y since now it's "illegal" to treat other humans equitably.
