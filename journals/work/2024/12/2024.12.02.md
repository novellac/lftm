### Coming soon!

- Do the stats screen on DFT.
- Figure out how the "Delete column 8" type labels should be formatted. I like the idea of translators being able to translate the whole string, and we do need to show the "Column" or "Row" label.

### General reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- There are a lot of things happening right now. YOU are unfortunately the mature one.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.
- BIG PIE

### Random notes

-

#### Stressors

- I'm feeling behind on the rubric project
- I would like to ask for a raise but I'm not sure when or how or if it would jeopardize my job.
- Treatment of a friend at their workplace.
