### Notes
ItemDisplayMixedCategoryItem had an `itemSelected` emit that used to come from MediaCard but was removed about 3yrs ago in PR629. I removed the emit from ItemDisplayMixedCategoryItem.

defineOptions({
  inheritAttrs: false
})

const button: Ref<ComponentPublicInstanceWithFocus | null> = ref(null)
const popover: Ref<ComponentPublicInstance<typeof AssignmentInfoPopover> | null> = ref(null)

defineEmits<{
  'update:copyOption': [option: CloneOption],
  'update:selected': [selected: boolean]
}>()
