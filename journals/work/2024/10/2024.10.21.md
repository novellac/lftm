## Monday 10.21

- x Create RubricCriterion stories and units files
- x Create the RubricHeaderText component, as well as its stories and units files.
- x Look at what the students see when they see the graded rubric. I think it's just the selected state.
- x Do any units remaining (maybe for the columns computed?)
- x Make a PR for the "view mode" (what a student sees)
- Create the button versions of the cells


### Soon

- Start the CS50 course
- Work on DFT
- Go to TJs
- Lowes for towel bar, caulk, caulkinggun, etc
- Start on the editable (or the gradeable?) mode.
- Make PR for updating the datatable borders to grey-300 class (vt-border-standard-primary?)

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- There are a lot of things happening right now. YOU are unfortunately the mature one.

### Notes

#### Stressors
- there's a new person at work
- junior on side project being so wrong and trying to convince me that they were not wrong
- I want to be working on the house
- I am instead working on a nebulous project I want to do well. I think if I just took off for a week they'd probably have someone else work on it and they'd do it in a disorganized manner.
