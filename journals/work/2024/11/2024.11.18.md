## Tuesday 11.19

- 

### Soon

- Start the CS50 course
- Figure out how the "Delete column 8" type labels should be formatted. I like the idea of translators being able to translate the whole string, and we do need to show the "Column" or "Row" label.

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- There are a lot of things happening right now. YOU are unfortunately the mature one.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- The inspection passed!!! House is COCable!!!

-

#### Stressors

- Packing to move Friday
- Figuring out which things to trash (and getting B to allow me to trash them)
- I kind of wanted to do the Share modal revamp
- I'm feeling behind on the rubric project
- I am stressed by the lack of movement on the notifications project
- I would like to ask for a raise but I'm not sure when or how or if it would jeopardize my job.
