## Wednesday 11.13

- Last week I refactored the hell out of the data table.
- Today I refactored (yet again lol) my RubricTable to be ok with the DataTable and have to rewrite as few internals as possible!
- Today I got in the popovers and got them tested!

### Soon

- Start the CS50 course
- Work on DFT
- Figure out where the popovers should be attached to. Can we use Teleport? Just regular absolute positioning? idk!
- Figure out how the "Delete column 8" type labels should be formatted. I like the idea of translators being able to translate the whole string, and we do need to show the "Column" or "Row" label.

### Reminders

- Don't forget to be tactical, too.
- Pull back on the quirkiness at work.
- There are a lot of things happening right now. YOU are unfortunately the mature one.
- It's ok to be hopeful. It doesn't make you less wise.

### Notes

- The renters seem to have come and done a good job on the painting!

-

#### Stressors

- We are almost to the inspection stage of the house process!!!
