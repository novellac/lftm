To promote the concept and culture of tech squads as a method for professional development and a professional support network for individuals from underrepresented genders (women, non-binary and trans folks) in the fields of UI/UX design, product management, web development, and interrelated fields (tech).

trying to communicate that we promote tech squads as a method for 2 primary things:
(1) professional development, and
(2) professional support network
I want to equally emphasize these two things for tech squads themselves (not the CoT org) â€¦. the tech squad offers the opportunity for professional development and a professional support network, and we as CoT are promoting this idea, as well as helping squads get together and their success as a squad.

To promote the concept of tech squads as a nexus for professional development and networking.

The mission of Cherry on Tech is to promote the concept of and facilitate the successful creation of small, self-sustaining tech squads as a nexus for professional development and networking, especially among individuals from underrepresented genders (women, non-binary, and trans people) in the fields of UI/UX design, product management, web development, and related tech fields.
