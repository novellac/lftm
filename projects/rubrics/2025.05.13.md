## Current state of things

- I tried sending an edit call to task endpoint but it is giving a 500 with some error text I forget
- I tried the delete call to task endpoint and that works!
- I have work done for the delete functionality but have not put up a PR yet. I'm waiting for the current latest PR to get approved since it touches some of the same files
- I'm currently working on making the presets (finally)
