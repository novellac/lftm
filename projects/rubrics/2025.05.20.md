I need to figure out where to do some things:
- Prepare the empty rubric
- Do the validation
- Package the filled up rubric (it will not necessarily be a valid rubric, but needs to be saveable by the BE) for sending to the BE rubric endpoint.

Places I could possibly do these things:
- RubricEditView (pass it the metadata and taskId, and do the rest in the script block)
-- Issue with this is that this is where we'll probably do the validation.
- SetupTableDataForRubric
-- Okay but who would call it? I guess RubricEditScreen could call it and hand it to RubricTable.
-- I guess we could do ALL of the prep, validate, and packaging up here.
- RubricTable
-- Issue with this is should I be storing busuiness logic here? How "smart" do I want this component to be? Not very! I'd rather keep the smartness in the Setup file tbh.
