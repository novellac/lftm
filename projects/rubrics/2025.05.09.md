# The current state of affairs!

## Creating a new rubric

- "Rubric options" button that launches a modal
- In the modal, we'll have a create link
- Eventually we'll also have things like searching for and choosing from existing rubrics that you can use

### What the manifest is sending

The manifest is sending one `RubricButton` in a `DialogContainer`.

### Potential issues

The `DialogContainer` has to be a tiny bit smart? It will check if the name is `rubricOptionsContainer` and if so, it will call `RubricOptionsDialog`.
However I think this is mitigated for future use by the `name` property. It's a top level property and if another kind of feature needs to use `DialogContainer`, we can add a switch case and show `NewThingDialog`.

## Editing a current rubric

- "Edit rubric" link that opens in an external tab
- "Remove rubric" button that makes an API call to the BE to remove the rubric from the task

### What the manifest is sending

The manifest is sending two `RubricButton`s in a regular Container.
