2025.04.22 Rubric new example route https://localhost.voicethread.net:3001/rubric/edit
2025.04.22 Rubric edit example route https://localhost.voicethread.net:3001/rubric/edit/26033

2025.04.22 Questions
- What task(?) property am I using to save the "visibility" (student feedback vs private note-taking)
- What task(?) property am I using to save the "Rubric type" (grade use - use points to tally or text-only)

2025.05.02 Rubric Buttons thoughts
Create rubric - external link with the task ID as an arg
Edit rubric - external link with the rubric ID (no task ID necessary?)
Delete rubric - button which makes a call to Task
2025.05.05 - I did this ^ (except for the delete button, haven't done that yet)
