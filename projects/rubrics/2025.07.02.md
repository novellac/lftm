# Testing for col/row hiding

## Passfail

- None of the header cells should have a trash button
- Rows should have criteria trash buttons until there are only one of them
- If one row, then no criteria trash button

## Issue: Rubric name and Assessment type getting overwritten

Guess: Maybe the task call is setting our internal FE data to its response. Well the first time we make that call, the task won't have any data about the rubric.


### Short TODO list
- See if I can track down changes to the rubric metadata
- Is a rubric patch call getting made with the wrong/non-existent data from task?
--It seems so! At least, there is something coming from task that has the wrong assess type and no name (bc task has no rubric name)

### Things I tried
- Using discrete type=button buttons for the init and edit screen submissions.

### Outstanding questions
- Why is the patch call to rubric that I only expect runs when we're doing an update running right away (when validateAndContinue is called)?
