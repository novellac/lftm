    Plan tooling with the feature/rubric/phase5 branch is called `berubric`

## Outstanding issues/questions

- How do we get the max points in the upper left corner of the rubric table when in the "view" mode? Should we get it from the assignment? Can BE send it with the rubric (and I don't care where they get it from)?
