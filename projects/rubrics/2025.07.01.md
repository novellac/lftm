Up at the "top" parent, we set a ref that controls whether or not the rubric panel is open.
Way down in the assessmentInput, we have a button which emits a click (and no value, I think).
That click from the assessmentInput bubbles up to the "top"
The ref at the top changes
The prop goes back down to the button
The prop tells the button what text to show
Later, the prop would be used in combination with a selected prop to set aria attributes like expanded and controls.

1. x Create ref in top parent controlling whether the panel is open.
2. x Pass prop down to button.
3. x Control button text via prop
4. x On button click, emit the click up to the panel
5. x In top parent, change the ref


Caveats: This will just open the panel. The panel will still need to be populated by the current student's gradebook, rubric, etc.
