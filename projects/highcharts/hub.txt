Questions:
- Will a user be able to look up reports for more than one org? (almost certainly yes)

org id: 25823891 (240150 on prod)

Page in manager: https://localhost.voicethread.net:3000/25823891/analytics

Seems like the org_usage_b is only tracking one person.

Questions about the endpoints:
- How are user minutes calculated? (I think this is a col in the db)
- Why don't I see any slides created? (the db doesn't have any data bc the dev BE doesn't support it - running cron did not work)

Plan
- ✅ Make a page in manager
- ✅ Use the orgId from the route (there is an example for this /managerV2/<org id>/reports/accounts/inactive)
- ✅ If on dev, use the mock data toggle 
- Ideally have one component you can feed report ids, right? Maybe not, since you need different kinds of labels, title, and subtitles.
- OOF - I think my `SetupHCChart` file is right now very tied to the PIE chart. I need to tease out what stuff in there is unique to the pie and what's useful for other things, or if I just need to have separate files for each.
